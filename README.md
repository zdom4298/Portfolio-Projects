# Alex The Analyst Bootcamp
  This repository contains some of the portfolio projects I made while completing 
 Alex The Analyst's Bootcamp on YouTube.   
# SQL
I used the Microsoft SQL Server Management Studio to complete the SQL projects.
During data exploration, I ran into errors for some of the code I commented on, 
tried to solve them myself, and found alternative queries. 
# Excel
 For this complete Excel project, I cleaned and filtered the data from the bike sales database.
 I also generated multiple pivot tables and a dashboard was created to visualize the outcome of the analysis. 
 I've included for you the detailed results below.
